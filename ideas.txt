Potential ideas Please include which topic you're aiming for too
topic 4 

Disha
Retail & Loss Prevention
Detect:
Suspicious handling of products
Concealing items
Unauthorized stockroom access

Elderly Care Monitoring
Detect:
Taking medication
Drinking water
Falls or risky interactions

Out of my ideas, this one felt more compelling so I explored it a lil more.
Smart Surveillance (Retail Loss Prevention) HOI Project
Core Focus: Human Object Interaction (HOI), where the system interprets intent through action recognition rather than just identifying items.
Key Interactions: Capable of detecting complex behaviors such as:
Product Selection: Distinguishing between browsing and picking up items.
Concealment Logic: Triggering alerts when a product’s bounding box merges with a person/bag and disappears.
Zone Security: Monitoring unauthorized entry into restricted stockroom areas. (not sure abt this feature)
Technical Alignment: Perfectly fits Topic 4 by analyzing the spatial and temporal relationships between a person, an object, and a specific action.
Implementation & Feasibility: * Edge Optimized: Highly feasible on NVIDIA Jetson using standard RGB camera feeds; no specialized hardware required since he said we have to try and use the hardware provided.
Data Control: We can relatively easily collect and label a custom dataset using staged, retail scenes to finetune.
Impact: Good live demo potential—simulating a "smart store" setup that is directly relevant to the multi-billion dollar retail AI industry and would look good on our resumes
Specific features: Flexible idk yet

Kashish:
--Smart Event Detection(CAR/Moving Vehicles)
------ Detect: Can distinguish between humans, vehicles, and animals to reduce false alarms

-- Disaster damage control
------ Detect: Humans through thermal detection in a fire etc.
