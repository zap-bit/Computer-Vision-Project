Potential ideas Please include which topic you're aiming for too
topic 4 

Disha
Retail & Loss Prevention
Detect:
Suspicious handling of products
Concealing items
Unauthorized stockroom access

Elderly Care Monitoring
Detect:
Taking medication
Drinking water
Falls or risky interactions

Out of my ideas, this one felt more compelling so I explored it a lil more.
Smart Surveillance (Retail Loss Prevention) HOI Project
Core Focus: Human Object Interaction (HOI), where the system interprets intent through action recognition rather than just identifying items.
Key Interactions: Capable of detecting complex behaviors such as:
Product Selection: Distinguishing between browsing and picking up items.
Concealment Logic: Triggering alerts when a product’s bounding box merges with a person/bag and disappears.
Zone Security: Monitoring unauthorized entry into restricted stockroom areas. (not sure abt this feature)
Technical Alignment: Perfectly fits Topic 4 by analyzing the spatial and temporal relationships between a person, an object, and a specific action.
Implementation & Feasibility: Highly feasible on NVIDIA Jetson using standard RGB camera feeds; no specialized hardware required since he said we have to try and use the hardware provided.
Data Control: We can relatively easily collect and label a custom dataset using staged, retail scenes to finetune.
Impact: Good live demo potential—simulating a "smart store" setup that is directly relevant to the multi-billion dollar retail AI industry and would look good on our resumes
Specific features: Flexible idk yet

Kashish:
--Smart Event Detection(CAR/Moving Vehicles)
------ Detect: Can distinguish between humans, vehicles, and animals to reduce false alarms

-- Disaster damage control
------ Detect: Humans through thermal detection in a fire etc.

Hassan: 
Gesture-Controlled Command System:

- Detect custom hand gestures (thumbs up, stop, peace sign, point left/right)

- Map gestures to simple commands (start timer, switch slide, etc.)

- Collect and label gesture images/videos

- Use hand detection + classification model

- Evaluate gesture recognition accuracy

- Demonstrate live control using camera

Real-Time Object Usage Monitoring

- Detect when certain objects are being used (cup lifted, phone picked up, notebook opened)

- Combine object detection with simple temporal logic

- Collect labeled video clips of object interactions

- Train YOLO-based detection model

-Evaluate precision, recall, and latency

- Run inference live on Jetson

Topic 1 :- 
Smart Desk Assistant: detects and traks common desk items (phone, wallet, keys, ...) in real time 
- can detect common desk items
- track each items with an id like Obj001
- can count item on desk in reak time
Mini Sore Checkout counter: 
- detects items(bottle, book, charger...) as they pass through a checkout zone 
- counts them when crossing the zone
- track them to avoid double crossong.

Topic 3
Gesture controlled command system
- can detect hand gesture like thumbs up, fist, open palm...)
- map gesture to commands
- maintain stable detections

Pose based injury risk alert
- detects abnormal joint angles comared to a normal range
- detect the left-right asymmetry for example one arm moves very different than the other
- detect guarding behavior like if a person keeps one limb close and avoids moving it
- deect sudden collapse or low movement after fall pluse immobility.
